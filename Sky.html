down highway 395 Tom sat dead still contemplating the machinery of
thought. His body a ventriloquist dummy, right hand shifting gears as
if possessed by the god of intuition. “He not busy being born is
busy dying”, Bob Dylan blared from Tom’s weak dysfunctional
speakers. Tom’s eyes were freshly butchered ribeye’s, marbled
with tinged echoes of madness and interspersed with striated cracks
of hope. His pupils were dilated as if his face had been torn off and
replaced with that of a poorly sewn owls. Death Valley was a long
shot eight ball racking Tom’s thoughts, a shivering bet of
redemption. Three sheets of acid and a six pack were all Tom cared
about. A tent and near empty campfire stove were mere necessities. A
Colt Defender lay dormant in his glove box, an abstract meditation of
infinite possibility.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

sat in his cubicle pleasantly bashing away on his trusty keyboard, a
dear friend of whose feelings he understood clear as the Utah sky.
Spitting out functions like a broccoli fed toddler, Tom gained steam
and blessed the holy screen with entrancing productivity, hoarding
host and guzzling the blood of Christ, hypnotizing the choir and
finessing the pipe organ with singular virtuosity. Lunch was out of
the question, Tom was on a mission. Tom’s firm dealt with financial
analytics, requiring Tom to manage the security of monetary
transactions. Tom had as dull and philosophically distant job as one
could painfully imagine, Jung careening backward from his sweet
little light. Although his purpose was easily dismissible in the
grand chaos of life, he was endlessly pleased to contribute to the
structure of unnatural order. Although Tom was happily engrossed in
his work, he was exceptionally excited at the prospect of proposing
to his lovely girlfriend Fiona, the second place unhealthy obsession
controlling the diaspora of his meaningless existence. This
despicable display of unwarranted positivity drove Fiona insane, her
inevitable onset of dementia, reducing the timeline of her peaceful
vitality. Fiona hated Tom with a creative passion. Thoughts of unlit
carbon monoxide garages and drunken freight train nightmares provoked
hypnotic sea-foam dreams and exacerbated a deep concentration of the
borderline psychotic American dream. Fiona taught preschool. She
despised her job. Tom sat complacent and stiff behind the endlessly
rotating steering wheel. Left, right, one, zero, on, off, the means
to an end with a brave beginning. Tom’s mind was a blizzard of
fearless energy. He imagined watching Neil Armstrong blow his brains
out while planting the American flag in the depths of our Nations
television existence.</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

crept by effortlessly as Tom stopped to take a piss by a sad looking
cactus, sagging needles like a broke desperate junkies daydream. Tom
sighed pleasantly as he watered the thirsty cactus. “Gotta keep
those needles sharp boy”. Tom was a delirious shit show, a shell of
past hope, a prizeless Cadbury egg. Tom snapped off a healthy needle
and calmly pricked his thumb, a drop of blood rising and falling to
the cracked desert earth. “Life’s a peach”, Tom said to the
cactus. There was no reply.</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

walked defeatedly down the constricting preschool hall, one kid
skipping by in a blur, her pigtails swaying in unison. Fiona cracked
a weak, sincere smile of pain. A tear slid effortlessly down her
cheek, falling to the pavement and evaporating instantly. The small
pool of depression devoured by heat. She opened the door of her beat
up Honda civic and sighed a warm breath of loss. “Life’s not what
I pictured, but Christ if it couldn’t be worse,” Fiona thought as
she started her car, the rusted motor churning like the knots in her
stomach. Fiona was good, Tom was good, conflicting points of view
brought war and psychology. Without the hurt, humanity would flat
line, children would cease to exist in their wise little bubbles of
hope, and stillness would envelop the land. Noise wouldn’t matter a
blink. Noise wouldn’t exist without life. Fiona’s slot machine
thoughts faded to static as she turned on the radio and tuned out.</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

drove fast, his teeth clenched, eyes bulging while he tightly gripped
the jet black steering wheel. His thumb was throbbing, he gripped the
wheel harder. “Who in his realms of love, who in his mirror,” Tom
loved a good dirge. Nervous echoes of past shadows brought down with
ramshackle poetic force. He sipped a yoohoo he’d bought at the only
seventy-six for miles, tank full, stomach empty. The sweet pseudo
chocolate felt cool and strange on Tom’s tongue. The engine
stuttered as Tom passed the last semblance of civilization before a
dead straight shot of endless desert highway. It was an old weathered
house, shattered windows and peeling white exterior. It seemed as
though somebody built it, only to run screaming on completion. “It
must be haunted,” Tom thought. He was correct, but like a
well-planned homicide, nobody would ever find out. Infinite vacancy,
entropy working its mysterious beauty. Tom took another sip of
yoohoo, grimacing at the thick sweet sickly contents. He tossed the
bottle out the window. Tom smiled at the faint sound of shattering
glass. That yoohoo never stood a chance. Tom hit the gas and felt the
rapid burst of increased speed in his ageing gut. He watched an oasis
in the distance, miraculous pyramids of genius design, tiny figures
soaked in blood, sherry red slaves being whipped like horses as they
placed one brick atop the next, masons of the past fearing their
pharaoh god. Moses could be their children’s salvation, and their
sinking lineages death sentence. A single olive execution.</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

sat calmly in her apartment eating cold sub-par chow mien from the
local greasy chino joint. “Chow Funk, what a god awful name,”
Fiona said aloud to her fat grey cat Horace. She ate measuredly,
being very careful not to drop the slightest bit of food. Her manners
were impeccable, her family made sure of it. Fiona’s dad was a
raving alcoholic, he’d recently passed. When the phone rang with
the grieving sobs of her sweet little mother’s voice, she’d hung
up and laughed so hard her ritz and peanut butter snack became lodged
tightly in her esophagus and forced her to run to her neighbor’s
for help. He squeezed firmly on her chest, the peanut butter snack
soaring through the air, slow motion beauty painting the wall of her
savior’s apartment. They’d slept together several times a week
after that. Tom was none the wiser. Fiona dropped a noodle on the
floor. Horace chomped on it gratefully. Fiona went into her bathroom
and stared in the mirror. Her brown eyes shimmered with a universal
wisdom, spiraling galaxies of a woman’s knowledge far beyond anyone
Fiona’s age had any right to possess. “A curse,” she thought.
It was a blessing. Fiona was fairly pretty, a tall thin brunette,
sharp angular features that excited a tone of authority and purpose.
She raised the small stick, the tiny blue line racking her mind with
hate. She’d done the abortion deal. That awful, hot little room,
wide eyed men with epileptic knees, calm young ladies like handcuffed
convicts, knowing and accepting their plight while sad pale
boyfriends cried hysterically with joy and discomfort in their
selfish one note heads. It was the neighbor’s kid. Tom never stood
a chance.</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

was unraveling, his instability rising. He saw a man on the side of
the road kneeling low and inspecting a flat on the rear left tire of
his pathetic looking Toyota pickup. “Fucking chink mobile,” Tom
said, drooling and grinding his teeth. His eyes were pink and wild.
He hadn’t slept for days. A manic man with no past and no hope in
hell of a decent future. Tom slowed to a crawl and rolled down his
window. “Need a hand there?” Tom asked grinning far too wide. He
was in dire need of a Manchester smile. Tom licked his lips at the
thought. “That’d sure be kind of ye,” the man said
breathlessly. He had a patchy black mustache and beat up straw bent
cowboy hat and was, contrary to Tom’s racist ramblings, white as a
snowflake. Tom narrowed his eyes and studied the man with an acute
awareness of the lonely desert highway stretching in all directions
toward an infinity of empty horizon. Tom reached instinctively into
his glove box and extracted the Colt Defender. He tucked it in his
belt, a child playing sheriff. Tom rolled up the window and stepped
out of the car. He slowly approached the harmless man. “What can I
help ya with there bud?”</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

toward Tom. “Don’t tell me you’re fucking name you little
backwards prick,” Tom whispered, ears steaming. “What was that?”
the man asked frowning. “Nothin at all, just thinkin is all, names
Tom.” They shook hands cordially as Jim produced a beat up wrench.
He handed it to Tom and turned back toward his vehicle. Tom watched
him hypnotized, barely registering the man’s scrambled, deep coded
words vibrating meaninglessly against his skull. “Been workin at
this for ages. Aint no mechanic, but I get by just fine. Old Brenda
here’s been good to Jim.” Tom caught the last bit, shivering at
the notion of a man referring to himself in the third person. “You
don’t say,” said Tom, teeth ground straight like a horse. Tom
raised the wrench high and brought it down like a whip against the
back of the man’s shoulder, the sickly crack of bone slicing
through the white hot desert heat. Jim screamed and gasped, rolling
on his side and shaking violently as he clutched his broken collar
bone. “FUCK, WHY, JESUS MAN!” Jim was crying in shock and pain.
“Pathetic little beetle, sucking up the air of the civilized,”
Tom thought with true, unflinching belief. He pulled out his Colt
Defender and aimed it at the man’s right leg. Cocking the gun, Tom
pulled the trigger bullseye on Jim’s shin. Jim screamed louder,
helpless, unearthly sounds as blood sprayed from his leg, tagging his
car with flecks of plasma and splintered shinbone. Tom cocked the gun
again and fired into Jim’s broken collar bone. Jim’s eyes rolled
back in his head and he lay still as he struggled for breath. Tom
cocked the gun one last time and pressed it to Jim’s right eye.
“Which layer Jim?” Tom asked quietly. “Please, oh Jesus I have
a son, I have a family…”</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

impatient. “Please, please don’t.” Tom pulled the trigger
firmly. Jim’s face disappeared in a red mess of violence as brain
and skull painted his tire. Jim lay peacefully, half his face caved
in, blood spurting in short pathetic bursts. “You bastard. You had
your pick of hell,” Tom said as he unloaded randomly on Jim’s
corpse. Tom thought briefly, rolled Jim’s small body under the car,
and swiftly kicked the jack. The truck came down fast, crushing Jim’s
body, bones snapping, tendons shredding. Tom smiled wide as he
stepped into his car. Nobody deserved a Manchester smile more than
broken old Tom.</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

awoke from her nap in a haze of smoky nightmares. Fractured visions
of dying infants lying in fields of buckwheat. She walked disoriented
to her bathroom, showered and brushed her teeth. Fiona stepped into
her kitchenette and pulled out a bottle of blue label from her
cupboard. She couldn’t remember where it had come from, some long
past, forgotten gift. She poured a stiff thumb into an old tumbler
with a picture of Charlie Chaplin adorning its side. It had been her
fathers. She had no idea why she’d held on to the glass.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some
prototype of love resided deep down in the caverns of her psyche.
Fiona sipped the drink slowly as she contemplated her childhood.
Being an only child, Fiona took solace in the warm, cheerful embrace
of her mother, kissing her on the cheek and grinning, her kind face
with its swollen purple right eye and glowing demeanor. Fiona
finished her scotch and walked out of her door, down the stairs, and
out of her complex into the cool evening air.</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

aimed true and shot at a star. &quot;Damn, just missed it.&quot; He'd
lost focus and aimed a hair left. The desert had cooled, the weighted
air of day shifting with polarity to a weightless night. The sky was
infested with stars, an alien fireworks show, the finally of some
divine lunar scape. Cutting his losses and mindful of the degrading
pile of loose bullets resting idly in his glove box, Tom walked
defeatedly to his car and cracked open a beer. He drank half and sat
in the driver’s seat. Cold sweat hung frightened on the tip of his
chin. Tom looked ahead with sharp focus, something was moving slowly
through the desert. A tall, black-coffee figure moving gracefully
through the landscape. A deer moved into view of Tom's weak
headlights. Something was off. The deer was shuffling across the
highway on its hind legs with jerky, measured purpose. The deer
slowed its movement and stopped dead in front of Tom's car, slowly
turning its head and staring straight at him. The deer's eyes were a
searing indigo fire, far too human esque, quiet orbs of torture. The
creature peered into Tom's soul. Tom was numb and thoughtless as he
watched in wonder. His thoughts awoke and swayed gently toward a
straight- razor mistake as the creature smiled wide at Tom, winking
knowingly before turning and shuffling away past a cactus and into
the temperate desert night.</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

drove purposefully, frowning slightly, her delicate eyelashes curled
beautifully as she staunchly followed every rule of traffic, glancing
occasionally at her speedometer. Fiona felt empowered at the prospect
of ditching Tom. Their date was planned entirely around a quick and
painless escape. Cars rushed by aimlessly, a stark contrast to her
lawful precision. Fiona approached a seventy-six and sat patiently
while gas streamed into her tank. The young attendant stood idly,
watching Fiona with a forlorn expression while a small lady screamed
gibberish at some invisible presence behind him. Feeling thoroughly
uncomfortable by this point, Fiona removed the pump and opened her
door. &quot;Be careful,” the attendant said quietly. Fiona looked
at him raising an eyebrow. &quot;What was that?&quot; The attendant
stared at her in silence, the woman behind him now speaking to a full
on jury. The restaurant was fairly close to the seventy-six. Fiona
pulled into the parking lot and shut off the engine, her confidence
momentarily waned.</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

right boot provoked a minute cloud of dust like a Hiroshima diorama
as he stepped out of his car. The rising sun projected a mosaic of
naturalistic poetry, a gorgeous palate of violet and turquoise,
Rousseau’s waking wet dream. Tom began the long desert trek, the
isolating span of perpetual morning hope invigorated his dehydrated,
dirt worn body. Tied fastly to his upper torso with thick well aged
rope, Tom's supplies were tightly secured within the canvas tent, a
boy's rucksack trekking through nature with a sheepish knowledge of
the impending supper call. The perimeter of mountains lay dormant in
the distance, a panoramic heard of beady eyed giants bowing in
meditation. Flashes of a past existence raced through Tom's mind,
poison tipped spears of regret flying savagely by with no strength
left for repulsion. The life of the meek should be cut down and
annihilated. Our precious realm of modern materialism leeched of its
foundation and replaced with well-planned Ebola holidays. The cold
steel barrel of Tom's gun pressed firmly against his withering
stomach, an isolated reaper of redemption. Tom reached the foot of
the mountainside, Death Valley's heart stretching in vast oppressive
glory sneaking closely behind him. Tom removed his tent and extracted
a single two centimeter square of nicely formulated acid and pressed
it gingerly against his tongue while cracking open a long since
warmed beer, draining it quickly. Realigning his makeshift&nbsp;hiking
pack, Tom began the long trek toward the mountain’s jagged peak.</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

the dining room. She spotted Tom sitting at a corner table adjacent
to the inquiring hostess. “We shouldn’t be long,” Fiona told
the overly cheery hostess as she made her way to the empty seat
across from Tom. He was studying the menu intensely, nose pressed
against the paper, rimmed reading glasses resting on the bridge of
his nose. Tom looked up, his frown quickly transitioning to a
beaming, overemphasized smile. “Ah Fiona, you look stunning!” Tom
said with all honesty. “Thank you Tom, how was your day, how was

Tom replied without pause. “We should talk Tom.” The waitress
placed small plates of artichokes with a practiced finesse in front
of them, tiny ramekins of aioli, pith-less lemon wedges adorning each
plate’s edge. Fiona despised artichokes. Out of any food
imaginable, Tom had to order the one she’d expressed to him a
considerable number of times her distaste for. Tom plucked a leaf
from his artichoke and dipped it contentedly into his little ramekin.
“I’m lost, and a lookin, for my baby,” Sam Cooke played quietly
from a speaker above. “I don’t think this is working Tom,”
Fiona said in a soft, near whisper. Tom stopped chewing and looked
up, a shocked expression on his face. He stared achingly at Fiona,
racking his brain for an appropriate response. Something to reverse
the haunting words he’d barely registered from Fiona’s lips. Tom
choked on his food and began coughing loudly while stuttering
nonsensical apologies and coercive phrases. “How can I change, what
happened? Please I’ll do anything!” Tom said, manic and
distraught. “I need some time for myself Tom, to figure out my
life, my future,” Fiona replied with sincerity. “I’m sorry Tom,
but that’s how I’ve felt for a long time. I’m so sorry.”
Fiona rose from her chair. “Take care of yourself Tom.” Fiona

purpose, an imaginary fixture of American idealism. “I’ve been a

boiling over, a slow burn witch trial of hate. He’d fastened a rope

thin, disposable hospital gloves on his trembling hands. Fiona spread
her arms yawning fervently and softly closed her eyes. “Good night
Horace.” Fiona smiled and scratched the cat’s head. Horace did a
quick shake and wandered off the couch. Fiona removed her dress and
climbed into bed, foregoing a night gown. The sheets felt cool and
soothing on her body, a curvy, delicate shape embodying youth. “It
won’t be like this for much longer,” Fiona thought, easing into a
restful sleep. Tom slid his key silently into the lock. Fiona hadn’t
asked for her key back, and Tom sure as hell didn’t mention he had

untied the rope surrounding the plastic bag. Tom watched Fiona
breathe, leaning in closely to feel her warmth. Tom slowly placed the
bag over Fiona’s head and took a deep breath. He lowered the bag
fast and clean on Fiona’s head, tightening the rope around her
petit neck. Fiona’s eyes flashed opened and she screamed violently,
thrashing and shaking her head. She tried to breath but the air was
lost. She was trapped in a vacuum without hope. Tom struggled to hold
the bag in place, forgetting the kitchen knife he’d placed on the
night stand. Fiona flung her arms feeling for something to grab and
felt the blade of the knife, squeezing it and feeling its sharp bite
dig deep into her hand. A steady stream of blood flowed from her
wound as she moved toward the handle and struggled to grip the blood
slick knife as she swiftly slashed at Tom’s waist. Tom screamed and
covered his mouth, all too aware of the thin walled apartment,
intimate flashback of sweat and pounding walls ringing like fire
alarms in his head. He squeezed Fiona’s wrist tightly. He grabbed
the knife from her slick red hand and held it high. Tom brought the
knife down with wild unhinged force, once, twice, Tom eventually lost
count. Tom was dripping with deep burgundy blood, his eyes stinging
from Fiona’s spurting wounds. She coughed and sprayed the plastic
bag red as blood filled her lungs and her vision faded to white,
fuzzy nothingness. Fiona saw her mother’s face, kind and wise
without a glimmer of hate. Her eyes were clear and clean, heavenly
blue lights of the past. Through the stained plastic bag, unbeknownst
to Tom, Fiona smiled in acceptance as death took her hand and guided
her to tranquility. Tom assessed Fiona’s body and cried again
before rubbing his hands together and regaining thought. He surveyed
the damage; stained sheets, lifeless body. “It’s been to hard

reached the mountain’s peak just as the afternoon heat simmered and
baked the impenetrable Death Valley air. The mountain leveled off
into a long stretch of cracked earth. He hiked with fractured purpose
along the endless plateau and set up his tent, retrieving the sheets
of acid and remaining beer. Tom stared at the sheets for several
minutes, eyes blurring and watering. He folded the sheets in a
precise sluggish fashion into a thin two by four inch rectangle. He
placed the sheets in his mouth and allowed them to dissolve, the
onslaught of schizophrenic nightmares soaking into his bloodstream.
Tom had taken two hundred ninety nine tabs, the event horizon loomed
in the distance. He drained the last of his beer and stepped from his
tent into the sun, kneeling, then sitting legs crossed, tipsy eyes
focused ahead. For two hours Tom sat, sweating bullets and waiting
for change. The stark hues of ragged desert terrain merged and
coalesced with the sun. Tom shook violently and rubbed his shoulders.
Voices yelled from plains of altered existence, a deer walked by on
its hind legs and smiled at Tom before grimacing and screaming in
horror, its face melting and collecting in beads on the desert floor.
An old, dusty computer lay on the brink of the plateau, the keyboard
tapping frantically as if possessed by demons of futurist design. A
woman approached, an initial speck on the limitless plateau. She
moved carefully toward Tom. Her figure morphed through space and
stood before him. It was Fiona. She looked beautiful, a young
unscathed soul depicting god’s presence and alleviating humanities’
sorrow with still, knowing exemption. Fiona smiled at Tom as he
looked into Fiona’s eyes. He began weeping, tears running down his
cheeks. A river of reticent shame. “I’m so sorry,” he
whispered, repeating the words until they lost all meaning. Fiona
approached and rested her palm on Tom’s head. She nodded to him, a
radiant light of being forever lost in the destructive jealousy of
ego. Tom felt a warm sensation on his chest. He looked down and saw
several deep, blazing red holes straight through his chest. Blood
pooled and replaced his dusty shirt with a bright fluid glow,
drenching his body with mindless hostility. Tom coughed and sputtered
as blood poured from his mouth. He gasped for breath as he choked and
convulsed. Fiona turned and glided away serenely down the sneaking
plateau. Tom lifted an arm, “don’t go,” he anemically choked
out. Those were his final words. Tom heard a shot and felt a white

pair of long haul hikers discovered Tom’s body several weeks later.
His skin was decayed, flies buzzing aimlessly around his ruined face,
distorted and mangled by a blast to the forehead. His chest was
riddled with holes. A pungent stench of death permeated the
suffocating desert air. A gun was held loosely in Tom’s left palm,
shells piled closely together. In his right hand, Tom held a cracked
tumbler with a picture of Charlie Chaplin gracing its side.</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
